## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Angular 17+

### What I learned

This is a multi-part website project and it is great for learning the basics of Angular framework.

For example:
- Interpolation binding,
- Property binding,
- Event binding
- Directives

What I learned is the child route, which is not complicated. It is like another route but the one difference is you place child routes in a children array within the parent route.

My first project based on Figma design.

### Continued development

This project is a bit messy. In the future, I will focus more on thorough planning before starting to build the web applications.

I would like to further develop this project as my knowledge in this area grows.
